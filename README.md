Privacy and Ethics: Automating facial recognition searches raises significant privacy concerns. Please ensure you are using such technology responsibly and ethically, respecting privacy laws and the terms of service of any platform you interact with.

However, there are a few significant challenges with automating this directly:

Lack of Public "Open Source Facial Recognition Sites" with APIs: Most reverse image search or facial recognition services available as websites (like Google Images, TinEye, PimEyes, FaceCheck.ID) are proprietary. They generally do not offer free, public APIs for submitting images and getting structured results back that a script can easily use. Their primary interface is manual website usage.
Terms of Service & Anti-Bot Measures: Directly scripting interactions with these websites (uploading images, scraping results) often violates their Terms of Service. Sites also employ measures like CAPTCHAs to prevent automated access, which would block such a script.
